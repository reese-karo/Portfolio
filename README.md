# <span style="color:#2e86c1">Welcome to Reese Karo's Portfolio</span>

Hi! I'm Reese Karo, a senior at the University of California, Santa Barbara, pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. My enthusiasm for mathematics and machine learning stems from a commitment to applying these fields to tackle real-world challenges. Currently, I am delving into numerical analysis and investigating the applications of machine learning and neural networks, particularly in solving complex partial differential equations. I invite you to join me on my academic journey and explore my innovative project solutions.

### Brain Tumor Classification Modeling
**Description**: This project involves predicting brain tumor types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The vignette explains the concepts behind CNNs and demonstrates their application in image classification.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python, Keras API, Tensorflow, OpenCV (CV2), Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn 

**GitHub Repository**: [Vignette on Brain Tumor Classification](https://github.com/Capstone-24-25/vignette-cnn)

### DataScout With Langchain
**Description**: Developed a Streamlit-based interactive agent using the Langchain API, which allows users to input a search query on a specific topic. The system enhances query relevance by dynamically retrieving up-to-date information from the web through an integrated crawling API. This ensures the language model provides responses grounded in the latest available data.

**Objective**: Large language models (LLMs) often rely on static datasets, making them prone to outdated responses. Data Scout addresses this by augmenting LLM responses with freshly crawled information, enabling users to receive timely and contextually enriched answers.

**Technologies Used**:
- Langchain, OpenAI Embeddings, Streamlit, GoogleSearch API, ApifyClient API
- Python libraries: langchain_community, streamlit

### Prediction of Car Auction Prices
- **Description**: Working with a kaggle dataset of over 100,000 observations that required transformation to the dataset and EDA to understand Using Tidyverse packages in R. Forecasted auction car prices using 100,000 observations and machine learning algorithms, with the Gradient Boosted Tree model achieving the best RMSE of 4095 in training data and 4268 on the test set.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - R (Tidyverse, DPLYR, ggplot2)
  - Machine Learning algorithms
    - Random Forests
    - XGBoost
    - KNN
    - Regression
    - Simple Neural Network  

### Black-Scholes PDE approximation
- **Description**:This project applies the Finite Difference Method to numerically approximate the Black-Scholes model for European call options. Through Python and Numpy, we've translated complex financial theory into a practical computational tool, supported by Matplotlib visualizations to demonstrate option pricing dynamics.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Finite Difference Method
  - Python
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib for Visualizations
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Accurate approximation of the Black-Scholes equation for call option pricing.
  - Efficient algorithm implementation demonstrating numerical analysis of financial models.
  - Insightful visualizations illustrating option price variations with underlying market changes.


### Data Scout with LangChain
An innovative project that creates an agent to analyze search queries, crawl multiple links, and generate follow-up prompts using the latest information. This project stands out by addressing the limitations of static datasets in language models, allowing for dynamically updated responses. 

- **Goal**: Provide users with intelligent and up-to-date responses to their queries.
- **Unique Features**: Combines real-time web crawling with natural language processing to enhance the relevance of generated insights, bridging the gap between static and dynamic knowledge bases.
- **Outcome**: Successfully implemented a pipeline that processes natural language queries and presents insights dynamically.

**Technologies Used:** LangChain, Python, BeautifulSoup, Selenium
