## Introduction
# Welcome to Reese Karo's Portfolio

Hi! My name is Reese Karo, and I am a junior at the University of California, Santa Barbara, double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. 
I have a profound drive and passion for mathematics and machine learning, especially in applying these disciplines to solve real-world problems.
My inspiration comes from my grandfather, a physicist who dedicated his life to working passionately in his lab. His dedication to science and love for his work deeply influence my approach to learning and research.
Currently, my primary interests lie in numerical analysis and delving deeper into the realms of machine learning and neural networks. 
I am particularly fascinated by their applications in solving complex partial differential equations, a theme that resonates through many of my projects.
Join me on this journey through my academic and project explorations, where I combine my love for mathematics with practical, innovative solutions.


## Projects Overview
From my numerical analysis class, we engaged in diving deeper into using Newton's and secant methods to help us solve for the volume of a gas using van der Waals equation. 
Another project was using 
Under my research with a professor in the math department, I have included some work involving Sparse Identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy), 
complemented with 3d attractors to help us find coefficients that drive the underlying forces to help create these attractors.

### Newton and Secant Methods for the Van der Waals Equation
- **Description**: The Van der Waals equation is used in chemistry to help, to help solve for molar volume of a gas, or for the temperature of the gas, depending on the context of the situation.
- By fixing the constants, we were able to apply the Newtons method and secant method to help us find the root of the equation by setting the equation to 0. This would tell us the value of the volume.
- **Technologies Used**: Using Numpy in Python to help us solve for the root of our equation, and Matplotlib to help us plot the function and make it easier for audiences.
- **Key Achievements**: Resulted in being able to solve for the volume of a gas when given every other piece of information such as gas constants, temperature, etc.

### Newton's Law of Cooling - Euler's Methods
- **Description**: 
- **Technologies Used**: Numpy in Python and Matplotlib
- **Key Achievements**: Able to approximate the slopes of the differential equation by implementing backward and forward Euler's method.

### Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDY)
- **Description**: Outline your research work on the Cahn-Hilliard Equation using the SINDY method, focusing on regression tools to return mobility coefficients.
- **Technologies Used**:
- **Key Achievements**:

### Additional Class Projects
From our regression analysis class, we practiced on real world data sets to help us find the best linear models to match the data. By using transformation methods learned in class such as box-cox,
we were able to transform the data to meet certain criteria for the residuals. These criterias amongst the errors like equal variance, uncorrelated, and gaussian distribution was vital to making accurate models.

## Languages and Packages
- Python
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplolib
  - Seaborn
- R & R Markdown
- SQL

## Goals and Future Projects
As a kid I was very passionate about sports cars and cars in general. Prices for vehicles can change based off many economical factors, which makes this a unique problem to tackle. Using data to train on from previous sales, we can try to model based off the given conditions of the vehicle.
The demand of a certain feature of a vehicle can help increase the prices of the vehicles, such as the transmission, or engine choice for example.
My future goals include creating a price predictor to help predict the pricing of selling vehicles from websites such as [Bring-A-Trailer](https://bringatrailer.com), 
and [CarsandBids](https://carsandbids.com).
I also am interested in furthering my knowledge on the techniques to solving Partial differential equations.
