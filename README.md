# Welcome to Reese Karo's Portfolio

Hi! My name is Reese Karo, a junior at the University of California, Santa Barbara, double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. My passion for mathematics and machine learning is driven by a desire to apply these disciplines in solving real-world problems, inspired by my grandfather, a dedicated physicist. I'm currently focused on numerical analysis and exploring machine learning and neural networks, especially their applications in solving complex partial differential equations. Join me in exploring my academic journey and innovative project solutions.

## Projects Overview

### Newton and Secant Methods for the Van der Waals Equation
- **Description**: Applied Newton's and Secant methods to solve for the volume of a gas using the Van der Waals equation. Adjusting constants allowed us to find the equation's root, providing the gas volume.
- **Technologies Used**: 
  - Python
  - Numpy for numerical computations
  - Matplotlib for visualizations
- **Key Achievements**: Successfully calculated the gas volume using given constants, temperature, and other relevant data.


### Newton's Law of Cooling - Euler's Methods
- **Description**: Newtons law of cooling is a simple differential equations, that can help track how the temperature of a hot object such as a coffee in a lower temperature room, will change over time. We then wanted to use methods to help solve for the temperature of a liquid object would be in a colder roomer over a period of time, using Implicit euler and explicit euler.
- **Technologies Used**: 
  - Python
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib for Visualizations
- **Key Achievements**: Able to approximate the slopes of the differential equation by implementing backward and forward Euler's method.

### Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDY)
- **Description**: SINDy is a tool that is able to help solve for the equations of dynamical systems, that can't be solved normally. By using least squares and regression tools, we are able to help solve for the coefficients that determine the system. The system we chose was the Lorenz Attractor
- **Technologies Used**: 
  - Numpy in Python for calculating slopes
  - Matplotlib and mpl toolkits for 3d visualizations, 
  - sckikit-learn for regression tools such as lasso and Ridge regression
- **Key Achievements**: By using an interated threshold for Least Squares, we were able to return a sparse set of coefficients that returned the correct coefficients to describe the Lorenz System

### Additional Class Projects
From our regression analysis class, we practiced on real world data sets to help us find the best linear models to match the data. By using transformation methods learned in class such as box-cox,
we were able to transform the data to meet certain criteria for the residuals. These criterias amongst the errors like equal variance, uncorrelated, and gaussian distribution was vital to making accurate models.

## Goals and Future Projects
As a kid I was very passionate about sports cars and cars in general. Prices for vehicles can change based off many economical factors, which makes this a unique problem to tackle. Using data to train on from previous sales, we can try to model based off the given conditions of the vehicle.
The demand of a certain feature of a vehicle can help increase the prices of the vehicles, such as the transmission, or engine choice for example.
My future goals include creating a price predictor to help predict the pricing of selling vehicles from websites such as [Bring-A-Trailer](https://bringatrailer.com), 
and [CarsandBids](https://carsandbids.com). I'm currently in the process of finishing up a similar project with a large data set of used Car Auctions sales, trying to predict the price of common vehicles. 
I also am interested in furthering my knowledge on the techniques to solving Partial differential equations which I am currently in the development of with the heat conductivity research.
