# Welcome to Reese Karo's Portfolio

Hi! My name is Reese Karo, a senior at the University of California, Santa Barbara, double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. My passion for mathematics and machine learning is driven by a desire to apply these disciplines in solving real-world problems, inspired by my grandfather, a dedicated physicist. I'm currently focused on numerical analysis and exploring machine learning and neural networks, especially their applications in solving complex partial differential equations. Join me in exploring my academic journey and innovative project solutions.

## Projects Overview

### DataScout With Langchain
**Description**: Developed a Streamlit-based interactive agent using the Langchain API, which allows users to input a search query on a specific topic. The system enhances query relevance by dynamically retrieving up-to-date information from the web through an integrated crawling API. This ensures the language model provides responses grounded in the latest available data.

**Objective**: Large language models (LLMs) often rely on static datasets, making them prone to outdated responses. Data Scout addresses this by augmenting LLM responses with freshly crawled information, enabling users to receive timely and contextually enriched answers.

**Technologies Used**:
- Langchain, OpenAI Embeddings, Streamlit, GoogleSearch API, ApifyClient API
- Python libraries: langchain_community, streamlit

### Prediction of Car Auction Prices
- **Description**: Working with a kaggle dataset of over 100,000 observations that required transformation to the dataset and EDA to understand Using Tidyverse packages in R. Forecasted auction car prices using 100,000 observations and machine learning algorithms, with the Gradient Boosted Tree model achieving the best RMSE of 4095 in training data and 4268 on the test set.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - R (Tidyverse, DPLYR, ggplot2)
  - Machine Learning algorithms
    - Random Forests
    - XGBoost
    - KNN
    - Regression
    - Simple Neural Network  

### Black-Scholes PDE approximation
- **Description**:This project applies the Finite Difference Method to numerically approximate the Black-Scholes model for European call options. Through Python and Numpy, we've translated complex financial theory into a practical computational tool, supported by Matplotlib visualizations to demonstrate option pricing dynamics.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Finite Difference Method
  - Python
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib for Visualizations
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Accurate approximation of the Black-Scholes equation for call option pricing.
  - Efficient algorithm implementation demonstrating numerical analysis of financial models.
  - Insightful visualizations illustrating option price variations with underlying market changes.

### Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDY)
- **Description**: SINDy is a tool that is able to help solve for the equations of dynamical systems, that can't be solved normally. By using least squares and regression tools, we are able to help solve for the coefficients that determine the system. The system we chose was the Lorenz Attractor
- **Technologies Used**: 
  - Numpy in Python for calculating slopes
  - Matplotlib and mpl toolkits for 3d visualizations, 
  - sckikit-learn for regression tools such as lasso and Ridge regression
- **Key Achievements**: By using an interated threshold for Least Squares, we were able to return a sparse set of coefficients that returned the correct coefficients to describe the Lorenz System

### Additional Class Projects
From our regression analysis class, we practiced on real world data sets to help us find the best linear models to match the data. By using transformation methods learned in class such as box-cox,
we were able to transform the data to meet certain criteria for the residuals. These criterias amongst the errors like equal variance, uncorrelated, and gaussian distribution was vital to making accurate models.
