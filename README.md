## Projects
### **Brain Tumor Classification Modeling**
**Description**:  
This project focuses on predicting brain tumor types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It explores various architectures and leverages advanced preprocessing techniques to improve classification performance on medical image datasets.


**Objective**:
- To identify the most effective CNN architecture for brain tumor classification, including experimenting with custom preprocessing using OpenCV and evaluating transfer learning for optimal results.


**Achievements**:
- Experimented with multiple CNN architectures, from simple 2-layer models to advanced 3-layer models with dense layers and Hyperband tuning.
- Integrated transfer learning techniques to enhance model performance.
- Achieved 93% accuracy and 97.4% AUC on the testing set with the transfer-learned model.
- Demonstrated that transfer learning is the most efficient approach when paired with robust preprocessing techniques.


**Technologies Used**:  
- Python, Keras API, TensorFlow, OpenCV (CV2), NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn  

**GitHub Repository**: [Vignette on Brain Tumor Classification](https://github.com/Capstone-24-25/vignette-cnn)

### **Data Scout with LangChain**
**Description**:  
Developed a Streamlit-based interactive agent using the LangChain API, which allows users to input a search query on a specific topic. The system enhances query relevance by dynamically retrieving up-to-date information from the web through an integrated crawling API. This ensures the language model provides responses grounded in the latest available data.


**Objective**:  
- Large language models (LLMs) often rely on static datasets, making them prone to outdated responses. Data Scout addresses this by augmenting LLM responses with freshly crawled information, enabling users to receive timely and contextually enriched answers.


**Technologies Used**:  
- LangChain, OpenAI Embeddings, Streamlit, GoogleSearch API, ApifyClient API  
- Python libraries: langchain_community, Streamlit  

**GitHub Repository**: [Data Scout](https://github.com/reese-karo/Portfolio/blob/main/DataScout%20AI/DataScout.py)

### **Prediction of Car Auction Prices**
**Description**:  
Analyzed a Kaggle dataset with over 100,000 car auction observations to predict vehicle selling prices. Conducted extensive data transformation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights. Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Gradient Boosted Trees, Dense Neural Networks, and XGBoost. Enhanced model accuracy through advanced preprocessing techniques, including scaling, normalization, and one-hot encoding using Scikit-learn pipelines. Optimized hyperparameters with Grid Search, K-Fold Cross-Validation, and Hyperband tuning for the neural network model.  

**Achievements**:  
- The Dense Neural Net model achieved the best performance with a validation RMSE of 2344 and a testing RMSE of 2380.  
- Conducted EDA with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to uncover data trends.  
- Leveraged Scikit-learn pipelines for seamless data preprocessing.

**Technologies Used**:  
Python: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
