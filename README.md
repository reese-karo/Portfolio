# <span style="color:#2e86c1">Welcome to Reese Karo's Portfolio</span>

Hi! I'm Reese Karo, a senior at the University of California, Santa Barbara, pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and Statistics & Data Science. My enthusiasm for mathematics and machine learning stems from a commitment to applying these fields to tackle real-world challenges. Currently, I am delving into numerical analysis and investigating the applications of machine learning and neural networks, particularly in solving complex partial differential equations. I invite you to join me on my academic journey and explore my innovative project solutions.

### Brain Tumor Classification Modeling
**Description**: This project involves predicting brain tumor types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The vignette explains the concepts behind CNNs and demonstrates their application in image classification.

**Technologies Used**:
- Python, Keras API, Tensorflow, OpenCV (CV2), Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn 

**GitHub Repository**: [Vignette on Brain Tumor Classification](https://github.com/Capstone-24-25/vignette-cnn)

### DataScout With Langchain
**Description**: Developed a Streamlit-based interactive agent using the Langchain API, which allows users to input a search query on a specific topic. The system enhances query relevance by dynamically retrieving up-to-date information from the web through an integrated crawling API. This ensures the language model provides responses grounded in the latest available data.

**Objective**: Large language models (LLMs) often rely on static datasets, making them prone to outdated responses. Data Scout addresses this by augmenting LLM responses with freshly crawled information, enabling users to receive timely and contextually enriched answers.

**Technologies Used**:
- Langchain, OpenAI Embeddings, Streamlit, GoogleSearch API, ApifyClient API
- Python libraries: langchain_community, streamlit

### Prediction of Car Auction Prices
**Description**: Analyzed a Kaggle dataset with over 100,000 car auction observations to predict vehicle selling prices. Conducted extensive data transformation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights. Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Gradient Boosted Trees, Dense Neural Networks, and XGBoost. The Gradient Boosted Tree model achieved the best performance with a validation RMSE of 2344 and a testing RMSE of 2380. Enhanced model accuracy through advanced preprocessing techniques, including scaling, normalization, and one-hot encoding using Scikit-learn pipelines. Optimized hyperparameters with Grid Search, K-Fold Cross-Validation, and Hyperband tuning for the neural network model.
**Key Achievements**:
Conducted EDA with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to uncover data trends.
Leveraged Scikit-learn pipelines for seamless data preprocessing.
Optimized machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter tuning, achieving a Dense Neural Network RMSE of 2380 on the testing set.
**Technologies Used**:
Python: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
